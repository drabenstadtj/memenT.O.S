    body: `Yeah I just got the email. I can't believe this.

I had like $3000+ worth of stuff on there. Ten years of collecting games, movies, everything. And they're just... deleting it? 

Did you read the part where they said "as per the Terms of Service"? Like that makes it okay? I never even READ those terms when I signed up.

Let me know if you find any way to save stuff. I'm scrambling right now.

- Alex`
